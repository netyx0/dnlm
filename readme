dnlm - DyNamic Login Manager

dnlm is a somewhat functional login manager very much inspired by ly.

it is lightweight (i think?) and has only one dependency, libcursedpotato,
which is my barely functional curses-like thing that really only works on the
linux virtual console. after installing libcursedpotato, to build dnlm, run:

$ make

to install it, run

$ make install

so far it has only been tested on artix with openrc, and the make install rule
only really works on that. but all it really does (in addition to moving the
compiled binary to an appropriate directory) is copy res/dnlm.openrc to the
directory where the init scripts live and copy res/dnlm.pam.conf to the
directory where the pam files (what are they called) live. read the makefile
for more details (it's actually mostly handwritten and human readable!)

have fun :)
